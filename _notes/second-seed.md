Is this your digital garden? It looks like shit. 

I should tell you about my books and sewing but it might trigger me. 

Oh, I know. I'll post my to do list and then just redact the parts that are embarrassing. 

1- clean my whole house
2- sew a baby's blanket
3- brain cancer sympathy card
4- mail stickers to friends (real and fake) 
5- stay out of your DMs (real)
