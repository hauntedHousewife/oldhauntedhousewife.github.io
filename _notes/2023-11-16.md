I woke up kind of early today. I took my son to school. He didn't eat his breakfast but I did give him one. Hell yeah. 

I wasted too much time not doing anything much really. I was supposed to make myself a new daily schedule to help with that but it's not  finished. Ran out of time. What if it makes me boring? I don't like it.

I'm going to start going to bed early and waking up early so that I can have time in the morning before the kids get up. I wonder how long that will last. WHAT IF IT MAKES ME BORING I DON'T LIKE IT.

Half days this week have me feeling tired. I have so many people to get back to and things to follow up on and a to-do list 8 miles long. And all the to-dos are old as shit. 

But we played outside and my kids laughed and ran and played with the neighbor and I cooked a [bland fucking dinner](whats-for-dinner.md) while I helped 6 with math and reading. Then we started his new journal so that I can help him with his writing, which is extremely subpar I guess. He is excited his teacher is going to write notes back to him.
