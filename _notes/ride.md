title: A room of His Own
---

Work all day for an ounce of peace so that I can work in peace. Sewing is women's work but it's not even like that. I just like to sew. And I want to sew in #here#, in an un-oppressed way. Don't make it sad.

And I need to think. Nothing deep, only normal things. 

I need to read, too. I have too many books going and the characters are starting to talk to one another. The books are mostly classics, but saying that makes me cringe. I don't think I'm fancy or smart for liking the older stuff. It's just that the murdering of husbands was handled so much more delicately then. Suicide was more beautiful. Old-timey genteelness pairs well with the game fuck, marry, kill. Yes. These are the things I like about old books. Not everything has to be so fast. Drag it out a little. It's about what you don't say.


Oh, and I need to write. Manifesto or grocery list? It's going to be a close call. I am a troublemaker. The frozen food section only makes it worse. 

Yes, it is quiet now. I wouldn't say peaceful, though. He watches me still. 

I could equate myself to a bird in a cage like every other fake-helpless and feeble bitch with a diary, but not without much throwing up in my own mouth. If I were a bird I'd be a clumsy one. A dumb one, too. There's no door that closes, save for the ones keeping me out of the fucking furnace, and those don't even close like they mean it. I could fly on out of here but I don't. I could get hurt. 

How am I enjoying working in his bedroom tonight, he wants to know? 

I thought this place was my office. We can not even agree where I am right now. Does it stop being my office as soon as he sleeps in here? It's comfy and cozy despite being haunted and almost completely exposed. So it beckons to him and he cozies up in it and so it is his now. 

My brain is confused. You don't go into your hater's house to unwind and start making art. That's psychotic. 

And so I ride instead. And he watches, asking questions. 

What time am I going to bed? 

You, sir, are annoying. I finger my book and turn up the resistance on my little bike, texting my creepy little notes into my phone. Maybe for later , maybe for never, maybe for a cute boy I know. I don't know. I'm reading A Room Of One's Own, and the irony is not lost on me when I consider that this room is definitely not my own. 

Maybe the resistance was a little high. I got cocky. I'M RESISTING!I started thinking that maybe I would just pedal this thing until the wheels fall off, and then one pedal really did fall off. The left one. That will happen after 8 or 9 years of abuse and (sometimes) neglect. Things fall apart. 

But how lucky am I to have a man here to fix my bike for me? This motherfucking guy is incredible. I could've done it myself but sometimes it's fun to make the patriarchy do things for you. Almost as fun as taking their money for doing things they don't even approve of.

He wanted to wait until later, but I was insistent. It was getting close to midnight and I was one minute away from closing my exercise ring. I need the D(ata). He gets that one thing.
